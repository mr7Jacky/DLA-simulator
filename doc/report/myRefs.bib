abstract="Ballistic aggregation models, as introduced in Sect. 7.2.2, allow for overhangs on the surface as a result of allowing particles to attach themselves to the aggregate if a neighboring lattice point is occupied. This simple modification of a solid-on-solid model can lead to an interesting behavior of the resulting aggregate. We consider only on-lattice ballistic aggregation in this chapter, where the particles can aggregate in the constraints of a cubic lattice. Other techniques allow for aggregation in any configuration, which is called off-lattice ballistic aggregation.",
